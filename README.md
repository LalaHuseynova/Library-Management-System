The goal of the project is to demonstrate knowledge you have obtained throughout the semester by applying OOP principles and all the main Java concepts (e. g. Collections, Exception Handling, Generics, Lambda Expressions, File Reading/Writing, etc.).
It is a Book Management system project. 
The Book Management System project is all about managing your books easily. The system facilitates all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for books, allowing users to add, view, update, and delete books from their collection. The system also lets you search, sort, and rate your books for better organization. It's got a secure login system to protect your data, and it's user-friendly with a nice graphical interface. Plus, it can handle multiple users and saves your data so you won't lose anything.

## General Database
In General database user only see the books and select them. User cannot delete add change or create in general database. In general database we have average ratings that given to a book, in the parenthesises we have number of users that give review to the book. In review section we have username that give the review for specified book and click on the username we can see review of this books. 
***Sorting***, by clicking the headers of table, you can sort whole column. When clicking 1 on the specified column ascending, clicking 2 descending, clicking 3 table comes to the original.
**Note:** We apply all pages sorting and search bar in order to make our program ***user-friendly***.

- Chapter II: Filtering and Sorting
- Chapter III: Admin & User
- Chapter IV: Login & Registration
- Chapter V: Data Persistency
- Chapter VI: Initial Data â€“ The Brodsky List 

## Conclusion

The conclusion of this project is the creation of a comprehensive database system for managing books, user ratings, and reviews. It involves both a General Database for storing book information and a Personal Database for individual user interactions. The system allows for CRUD operations, sorting, searching, and persistency across sessions. Overall, this project aims to provide a user-friendly and efficient platform for managing and interacting with a library of books, catering to both general users and administrators. It combines functionality with ease of use, enabling seamless navigation, interaction, and maintenance of the database.
